# cs231n-iOS-StyleTransfer

This application is developed to run style transfer on an iOS device.
The style transfer model is running on squeeze net (something that I leant in CS231n).

I have setup a server on my ubuntu machine which runs the training of and returns the images. 
Apart from the listed packages in CS231n, you would also need :

pip install flask
